# You *must* pass in_dim/out_dim from your runtime (feature size and embed size).
# Many trainers merge this file into a higher-level model config where these get
# filled in by the pipeline. Example:
#   in_dim: ${features.dim}     # (resolve from feature builder)
#   out_dim: ${model.embed_dim} # (resolve from policy)

# If you have edge features (e.g., orientation/phase), set this to their size
# and provide edge_attr=[E, edge_dim] at runtime. Otherwise leave as null.
